# land-of-confusion
A game designed to test how observant you are.

## Description
This is a game that requires you to enter a word in the first box followed by a word in the second box. The game requires you to understand which words are used in the land of confusion and which words are not.
The program works by using regular expressions to check whether the word in box 1 contains 2 adjacent letters, for example, 'Trees' and whether the word in box 2 doesn't, for example, 'Leaves'.
